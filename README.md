## Quick Start

1. **Install** Sedunia on your platform of choice.
2. **Create a wallet** or import an existing one using a seed phrase or hardware device.
3. **Back up your seed phrase** — write it down and store it offline. Sedunia cannot recover it for you.
4. **Fund your wallet** by sending crypto to your address or bridging from another chain.
5. **Start trading** — connect to any DApp or use the built-in swap interface.

## Architecture

Sedunia is built on a modular, security-focused architecture:

\`\`\`
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              User Interface (React)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Trading Engine (Rust core)            │
├──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┤
│   Key Vault (WASM)   │   Routing & Quote API    │
├──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┤
│         Chain Adapters (EVM, SVM, BTC)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

- **UI layer** — React + TypeScript for the desktop, mobile, and extension clients
- **Core engine** — A Rust trading engine compiled to native binaries and WebAssembly
- **Key vault** — Isolated cryptographic module with no network access
- **Chain adapters** — Pluggable modules for each supported blockchain

## Security

Security is the foundation of Sedunia, not an afterthought.

- **Audits** — Audited by [Firm A] and [Firm B]; reports available in `/audits`
- **Bug bounty** — Up to $250,000 for critical vulnerabilities. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)
- **Reproducible builds** — Verify that the binary you run matches the public source
- **No telemetry by default** — Opt-in only, never tied to wallet addresses

If you discover a security vulnerability, please email **security@leverfi.io** rather than opening a public issue.
